# Project description

#### With current astronomical surveys the number of detected sources is already large and with future telescopes the volume of data will become huge, 
#### so that Machine Learning techniques will be required to seek out the interesting objects. Machine Learning is a rapidly expanding part of astronomy (and science 
#### in general) and this project will equip the student with a number of useful skills. This project will look at different angles of Machine Learning, A key
#### component of using Neural Networks to find objects in survey data (eg using Image Recognition) is the training set required to effectively train the Neural Network. 
#### These training sets can be generated in a number of ways and we will explore some different approaches. One approach will be to use a Generative Adversarial
#### Network (GAN) to generate synthetic images of the objects of interest (for instance, radio galaxies, non-thermal filaments, bow-shocks or  supernova remnants), 
#### which we can then use to train a neural network to search for these objects in a specific survey, such as the MEERKAT Galactic Plane Survey or the SPITZER GLIMPSE
#### survey. Another approach is to use analytic approaches to model radio galaxies or other objects of interest. Having generated synthetic training sets we will then apply 
#### them to search the survey data to look for objects in the different classes. We can then identify new sources of interest.
